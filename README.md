# Forward-Euler-Algorithm

This program uses a Forward Euler Algorithm to calculate the position of a star relative to another using Cartesian components to calculate velocities and accelerations for the corresponding axis components. Using timestep "dt", the program goes one timestep at a time through the evolution of the star over a given amount of time "ns". The program writes to a console the three position components of the star and the three velocity magnitudes, as well as writing them to an external .txt file. Using GnuPlot, the x and y coordinates of the star over a given time step are then plotted onto a graph for better visualization.
